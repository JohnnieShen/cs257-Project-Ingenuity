    * Author: Johnny
    * Summary: This script manages the blocks in the game. It allows for adding, removing, and checking the connections between blocks.
    * It also provides functionality to validate the structure of the vehicle by checking if all blocks are connected to the core block.
    * The script uses a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the BlockManager exists in the game.
    * It also provides functionality to enable or disable the physics of all blocks in the vehicle.
    * The script uses a dictionary to keep track of the blocks and their positions, as well as the connections between blocks.
    * It also provides a method to recalculate the connections between blocks and clean up any broken joints.
    * The script is attached to a GameObject in the scene and requires a reference to the grid origin for calculating local positions.
